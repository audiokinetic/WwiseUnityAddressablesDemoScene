# WwiseUnityAddressablesDemoScene

This package provides components and assets for learning how to use the Wwise Unity Addressables package. 
The tutorial section of the [official documentation](https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/edge/?source=Unity&id=pg_addressables.html) documents how to use Wwise Unity Addressables to package the assets in this scene.

This package should be added to a preinstalled Unity Demo Game, as it uses sound assets from that project.

## Dependencies
* [Wwise Unity Addressables](https://github.com/audiokinetic/WwiseUnityAddressables)
* The Wwise Unity Demo Game (minimum version 2021.1.0)
